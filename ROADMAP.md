# Yaskl Roadmap

- Write complete tests
- Switch version to (Int, Int, DateTime, MD5 of Datetime/description) to avoid possible collisions when multiple people are working on one code base. Make it nice to merge. Along with this change, should also append description to file name, and allow a generator for new versions
- enable database clustering
